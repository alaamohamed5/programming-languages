A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instruction to perform specific tasks on a computer or computing device. All languages (including assembly languages) at least assign a type to a value before it is operated on, as operations are not well-defined without data interpretation. Most languages also assign types to values which are stored simply in memory. <br>
One set of languages which is not assembly languages: values in memory (including registers) are only bytes and the programmer must implicitly keep track of their interpretation. Statically typed languages contain explicit statements limiting values types a to which a variable may be bound. The C++ and Java languages are statically typed. <br>Dynamically typed languages like Scheme and Python allow a variable to be bound to any value.<br>
 Some languages, such as ML, are typed dynamically but the interpreter uses type inference to assign static types autonomously where possible. Through language makes some programs easy to express, and others difficult to express. When a language is well suited to a problem domain, correct solutions to problems in that domain are the programs which make it easy to express. <br>
In fact, a well-suited language makes it easier to convey programmes. This is w√ºnschenswert! One way to design a language is to selectively add restrictions until the target domain has difficulty in expressing incorrect programs. The cost of designing a language is that certain correct and potentially useful programs also become difficult to express in the language. Language designers face a dilemma as most of the program's properties in a sufficiently powerful language are undecidable, like halting. One choice is to discontinue checking for certain properties until running time. We call dynamic checking to run-timedy. <br>
The allows a language to express many types of programs easily, but it does mean that the programmer has little assurance that the program is actually correct. Only thorough testing will reveal flaws in these systems and extensive testing is expensive. Experienced programmers should be able to extrapolate from the material in any case .<br>
