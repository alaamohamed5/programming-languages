<h2>C++ Language:</h2>
The language C++ has an object oriented structure used in large projects. Programmers can collaborate on each part of the program with one program in different parts, or even with one individual work. The object oriented structure also allows multiple reuse of code. This language is an efficient language. But, many programmers disagree with that
<h2>PHP Language :</h2>
The PHP language is used to design web pages, and is sometimes used as scripting language as well. This language is designed to create a fast website, and therefore includes features that make it easy to generate HTTP headers and connect to databases. As a scripting language, it includes a set of components permit the programmer to easily get up to speed. It does have more sophisticated object oriented features, however.
<h2>Java Language:</h2>
The Java language is a language of multiple platforms which is particularly useful in networking. Of course, with Java applets mostly this language is used on the web. However, in structure and syntax, this language is used to design cross-platform programs, as it is similar to C++. Java language is very easy to learn for C++ programmers, and offers some advantages of object-oriented programming. Like reusability and the writing of efficient code in Java can be difficult. But the speed of the Java language has increased nowadays, and version 1.5 offers some good features for easy programmaking.
